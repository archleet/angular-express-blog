# Angular Express Seed Example App

Based on the [Angular Express Seed](https://github.com/btford/angular-express-seed), this simple app illustrates how to use [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/) on a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) server to make a simple blog.

Also, to complete both ends of the stack, added mongo db/mongoose as the back end and bootstrap to make all pretty. Very basic right now but will be expanding this later on.

The script 'posts-create.js' in the db-scripts folder adds a few documents to a posts collection in the 'blogdb' database.
